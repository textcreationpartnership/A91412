            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>MASTER Pym his Speech to the Lords, at a conference on Friday the the 31 of <hi>December</hi> concerning an Information againſt the Lord <hi>DIGBY.</hi>

               <salute>My Lords,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>THe Knights, Citizens and Burgeſſes of the Houſe of Commons now aſſembled in Parliament, have commanded me to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to your Lorſhips this Information which they have received againſt the Right Honorable <hi>George</hi> Lord <hi>Digby,</hi> of dangerous conſequence, that if not prevented, evill and troubleſome events may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue, to the great hazarding of the peace of this Kingdome, and a great hindrance of the happy proceedings of this Parliament.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>My Lords,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I humbly crave your patience to declare to your Lordſhips what I am commanded concerning the ſaid Information, which is that hee the ſaid Lord <hi>Digby</hi> ſhould give forth report upon reading of the Petition and Proteſtation of the 12 Biſhops, That this Preſent Parliament was a forced one, That the Act, vote, and La<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>es that ſhall bee En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted herein without the votes and aſſent of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:157542:3" rendition="simple:additions"/> are void and of none effect, and not binding to the Subject.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>My Lords,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This report is of great danger to the State if proved againſt the ſaid Lord, in theſe three re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects as I under your Lordſhips favour con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives.</p>
            <p>Firſt, It is a great breach of the Rights and Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges of Parliament.</p>
            <p>Secondly, It intrencheth much on the preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of the King, and abridges his Royall Power.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, it is the firſt ſteppe to bring into this State an Arbitrary and Tyrannicall forme of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernement.</p>
            <p>Firſt <hi>my Lords</hi> it is a breach of the priviledges of Parliament for theſe reaſons.</p>
            <p>Firſt, it is againſt the free votes of Parliamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry proceedings, which ought to bee reſerved and unqueſtionable, during the free ſitting thereof.</p>
            <p>Secondly, It is aginſt an Act of Parliament in that caſe provided for not adjourneing or abrupt breaking off of the ſame. Theſe Acts my Lords was freely voted by both houſes freely and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly paſſed by his Majeſtie without any force or compulſary meanes uſed in any, or private working or inducing his Majeſty by any of the Members of either of the Houſes to doe the ſame: An Act vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted aſwell by the ſaid Lord as the reſt of this Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable Houſe; this report now of his muſt needs be againſt his knowledge and former free conſent in paſſing that Act contrary to this Informati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
            <p>3. One Priviledge of Parliament, and that is
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:157542:3" rendition="simple:additions"/> one of the greateſt is to accuſe and freely proceed to the puniſhment of delinquents, that have cauſed the troubles in this State, both in Church, and Common-wealth; this report is againſt this Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge, It oppoſes altogether our Proceeding a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Biſhops, accuſed as the greateſt delin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quents both in Church and State; for my Lords if a Parliament is forced in the abſence of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, how may then the Parliament proceed lawfully againſt them; If the Biſhops ſit and have their votes (although delinquents) in Parliament how can wee proceed (I beſeech you) againſt their votes, therefore under favour I conclude this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poer of the ſaid Lord is againſt this Priviledge of Parliament.</p>
            <p>4. To redreſſe the greivances of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, is a Priviledge of Parliament, this report is againſt this Priviledge, how I pray you my Lords can our greivances be redreſſed, when the oppreſſions, Iniuſtice and vexations, troub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of his Majeſties loyall Subjects, may not by the Biſhops, may not be called in qutſtion, nor the miſ-doers <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>herein proſecuted and puniſhed for the ſame.</p>
            <p>5. This report is againſt divers acts of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in this Kingdome, that have beene made without the voice or Biſhops in Parliament, as is on record in the Iournalls of thoſe, and thus my Lords, I have ſhewed you that how this report is againſt the priviledges of Parliament.</p>
            <p>2. My Lords, this information intrencheth on the royall power and Prerogative of the King, And that in two reſpects.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:157542:4"/> 1. His royall Prerogative in making, and enact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing lawes by Parliament, it reſting onely in his Power to paſſe or, refuſe the votes of Parliament.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>My Lords.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The King of this kingdome have the greateſt perogative (to require the Councell an aſſiſtance the whole ſtate upon any occaſion whatſoever, when pleaſeth him) of any Prince in the world unleſſe <hi>France,</hi> and under favour my Lords, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive a Parliament cannot be termed forced, when it is freely called, and willingly continued by the King, I conceive my Lords a forced Parliament (is) when againſt the free conſent of a King and his Lords without lawfull called by wtit men aſſembleth themſelves, and by force of armes ſit in Councell and inact lawes, not tending to the welfarre of the Kingdome. The Parliament holden at <hi>Oxford</hi> in the raigne of <hi>Edward</hi> 2. after the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy diſſolution of the Parliament at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> in the 10. yeare of that Kings raigne, was a forced Parliament, compelling by undue meanes, the King and that Parliament to inact lawes tending to the ruine of the whole ſtate of this Kingdome.</p>
            <p n="2">2 My Lords, this Information intrencheth on the Royall power of the King in makeing of Laws, for as before I haue touched Parliaments haue biue with out Biſhopps Lawes made and enacted without their vots, then by this ſuperſiou my Lords ſhould they be of no validitie the King re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained in his power, and let Biſhops be never ſo vile and diſſaffected to the tranquillitie and ſecure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the ſtate yet muſt they have votes in rectifiing and ſetting in order ſuch things as are am<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſſe in the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:157542:4"/> ſame, (aſwell by their owne procureing as others) which is not then likely to take any good effect, nay my Lords it is too Apparant they haue beene the greateſt oppoſers of our proceedings in ths Parliament the Cheifeſt cauſe noe more is doue by the ſame.</p>
            <p>3 Laſtly my Lords this Information is the firſt ſtepp to bring in an Arbitrary and tiranicall forme of Government, and that under favour for theſe reaſons.</p>
            <p n="1">1 Free Parliaments are the ſecureſt and ſafeſt Government that euer could be found for this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and that in reſpect of the power and wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom theirof, it is vpholden defended atd preſeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the whole body of the kingdome, therfore powerfull, the members therof are men elected, one of tenn thouſand by the whole ſtate, therfore the wiſe, then to oppoſe the proceeding there of to deny the Government therof is, to the intent to change the ſame and if charged to another forme (None being ſoe ſecure, ſoe powerfull and ſo wiſe) muſt needs be Arbitrary and ſoe, Tiranicall.</p>
            <p n="2">2. My Lords, I no lawes can be binding to the ſubject, but ſuch as are voted and aſſented to by the Biſhops, then none can be expected, but ſuch as are deſtructive to the ſtate, their affections being altogether aberted from free Parliamentary pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings and their deſignes, onely agitated, for the oppoſſing the government thereof, and wee cannot but dayly feare thereby the utter confuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thereof, of the ſame.</p>
            <p>Now my Lords having to my weake Abillity
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:157542:5"/> fulfilled the command of the Houſe, in ſpeaking ſomewhat of this Information I am to deſire your Lordſhips from them, that the ſaid <hi>George</hi> Lord <hi>Digby</hi> may anſwere the ſaid Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe be proceeded againſt, as the Parliament ſhall think fit.</p>
